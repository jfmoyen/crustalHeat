\arguments{
\item{time}{boiler-plate for ReacTran (time)}

\item{Temp}{boiler-plate for ReacTran (temperature)
This also allows to make both available inside the function, which is useful
if you need to do time or temperature dependent changes (such as k = f(T) )
(hook for future development)}

\item{pars}{boiler-plate for ReacTran, I suspect this is a better way to pass T_surf and friends...}

\item{T_surf}{surface temperature [Â°C] or [K]}

\item{k}{Heat conductivity [W.m-1.K-1]}

\item{q_moho}{Heat flux at the moho [W.m-2]}

\item{rho}{Specific mass of the crust [km.m-3]}

\item{Cp}{Heat capacity of the crust [J.K-1.kg-1]}

\item{HP}{Heat production of the rocks [W.m-3]}

\item{u}{Vertical velocity [m.s-1]}

\item{grid}{a ReacTran 1D grid object}

\item{scaling}{The size of the time unit. Since 1 sec is very short in crustal heat propagation,
the changes are minute and the steady-state solder struggles to find a solution.
A higher scaling value, of perphaps 1e7, does help.}

a list with one component, dTdt, the rate of change of temperature for each depth.

\description{
The heat transfert equation in a simple case: 1D-conduction + advection with heat production
and constant physical parameters. The boundary conditions are defined here as a base (moho) flux.
}
\note{
This function expects its parameters in S.I. units. In particular everything involving a time,
even though a power [W], is in seconds and probably has to be converted from Ma upstream.

All the physical parameters being constant, they are defined as reals (NOT ReacTran grids, for instance)
